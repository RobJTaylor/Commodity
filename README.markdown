## Commodity - Second Year Web Project
### Commodity is a collaborative second year university web project.
The course we were following needed a framework to be used - Web2Py was selected. This repository contains the entire project, which should run on a Web2Py server. I didn't do all the work myself, with my friend [Charlie Cross](https://github.com/AFartingHippo) also committing code. The code may be a little rough but is functional.
